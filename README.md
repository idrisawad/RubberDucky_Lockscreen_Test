# RubberDucky Lockscreen Test

This script will first wait for 1000 milliseconds (1 second) to allow the Android device to fully boot up and be ready for input. It will then type each of the 5 common PIN codes one by one, followed by an ENTER key press to submit the code. After each code is entered, there is a delay of 500 milliseconds to allow the device to process the input before the next code is entered.

Please note that this script is for educational purposes only and should not be used for any illegal or malicious activities. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that they have permission to access the device and to use this script.
